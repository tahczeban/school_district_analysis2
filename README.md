**OVERVIEW OF SCHOOL DISTRICT ANALYSIS:**

  The purpose of this analysis was to perpare a comparison of district school data for Maria, the Chief Data Scientist, to easily peruse for insights regarding the performance trends at school district levels. Math and reading scores were manipulated and analyzed for the Board presentation. Upon review, it was determined that the ninth grade class data from Thomas High School revealed various sustpect anomolies. For a comparison the ninth grade data was removed as NaN and the analysis was performed again. This compiled analysis utilized the following methods for data retreival:

  2) Find missing values and handle
  3) inspect and fix student names
  4) inspect and clean data
